This sketch will display a number of different
patterns on a pair of AdaFruit NeoPixel goggles,

Every time the goggles are powered up, they will
cycle to the next pattern in sequence. To move
onto the next pattern, press the reset button
and wait a few second.

There is a gallery of some of the effects at
